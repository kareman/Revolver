Revolver is a framework for building fast genetic algorithms in [Swift 2.2][swift-url].

## Features

- [x] Chromosomes: strings, trees
- [x] Genetic operators: reproduction, mutation, crossover (1-point, 2-point, tree crossover)
- [x] Selections: roulette, rank, tournament, random, best/worst
- [x] Terminations: fixed number of generations, fitness threshold, date scheduling
- [x] Evaluators: sequential, parallel, aggregate
- [x] Random generators: Mersenne Twister, arc4random, drand48
- [x] Everything listed above is ready-to-run, yet easily extensible. By subclassing base classes and conforming to protocols, you can customize almost anything.
- [x] Well-documented API and many usage examples.

## Compatibility
Revolver was built with the open-source implementation of Swift in mind. For that reason, a great deal of effort was put into making it compile on Linux.

Revolver is dependent on:

 - Swift 2.2 standard library
 - Foundation
 - libdispatch

Revolver can be run on:

 - Mac OS X
 - iOS
 - Linux (any distro capable of supporting the Swift runtime)
 
Revolver can be compiled on:

 - Mac OS X
 - Linux (any distro capable of supporting the Swift runtime)


## Documentation
Revolver is primarily documented with inline comments and Swift docstrings. If you prefer external documentation, check out the beautiful [HTML documentation][html-doc] generated by [jazzy][jazzy]. You may also be interested in reviewing a [my thesis][thesis], which is sort of a guide to using Revolver in practice.

### Bundled Examples
Apart from conventional documentation, Revolver comes with various usage examples.

Listed in the increasing order of difficulty:

 1. [MAX-ONE][example-maxone]: In which Revolver is introduced and configured to create the longest string of 1's.
 2. [Parallel Evaluation][example-parallel]: In which Revolver is shown to utilize multiple CPU cores to speed up fitness evaluation.
 3. [Knapsack Problem][example-knapsack]: In which Revolver is applied to solve an instance of a meaningful combinatorial problem.
 4. [Self-driving Car][example-car]: In which a simple 2D simulation is set up to drive a robot car with the help of neural networks.
 5. [QWOP][example-qwop]: In which Revolver produces human-competitive results, playing an online game.

### Minimal Working Example

```swift
struct MyChromosome: RangeInitializedArray {
    typealias Element = Bool
    static let initializationRange = 26...42
    
    let array: [Element]    
    init(array: [Element]) { self.array = array }    
}

class MyEvaluator: SequentialEvaluator<MyChromosome> {
    typealias Chromosome = MyChromosome
    
    override func evaluateChromosome(individual: Chromosome) -> Fitness {
        // TODO: Fill in the fitness function here.
        // You can return any Double between 0 and 1.
        return 1.0 
    }    
}

let elitism = Reproduction<MyChromosome>(BestSelection(), numberOfIndividuals: 5)
let reproduction = Reproduction<MyChromosome>(RouletteSelection())
let mutation = Mutation<MyChromosome>(RankSelection())
let crossover = OnePointCrossover<MyChromosome>(TournamentSelection(order: 10))

let alg = GeneticAlgorithm<MyChromosome>(
    generator: ArcGenerator(),
    populationSize: 200,
    executeEveryGeneration: elitism,
    executeInLoop: (Choice(reproduction, p: 0.50) ||| Choice(mutation, p: 0.25) ||| Choice(crossover, p: 0.25)),
    evaluator: MyEvaluator(),
    termination: (MaxNumberOfGenerations(60) || FitnessThreshold(0.5))
)

alg.run()
```
